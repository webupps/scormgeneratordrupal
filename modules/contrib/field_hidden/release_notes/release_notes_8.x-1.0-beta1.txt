Field Hidden 8.x-1.0-beta1


Created against core beta version: 8.0.0-beta4


Main issues
-----------
The D8 version of Field Hidden only defines widgets, contrary to the D7 version it doesn't define field types.
As such, the D8 version is not really a port of the D7 version.
But it should in most senses deliver the same effective benefit as the D7 version.
Only number types and _plaintext_ text/textarea fields are supported.


New features
------------
Hidden HTML element widgets for number and text fields.

Bug fixes
---------
None.

Security
--------
None.

Install/update notes
--------------------
None.


Special thanks
--------------
Amit Sedai (@amitsedaiz) initiated and layed the indispensable groundwork of the D8 version of Field Hidden.
