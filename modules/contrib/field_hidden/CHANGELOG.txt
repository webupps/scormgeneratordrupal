field_hidden 8.x-1.x, 2015-01-03
--------------------------------
* Issue #2400975 by jacobfriis:
Removed option (field_hidden_instance_settings_hide_defval) to (not) display default value element, because obsolete and only exists in D7 version because that fixes default value element display via Javascript (which some people might find 'offensive').
Removed module config form, and related permission, because the module no longer defines any config vars.
Removed all admin resources, stylesheets and routes.
Finished release note.
Removed copyright text/notice, which ascribed copyright of the module's source to a single developer/maintainer.
Renamed widget classes to accord (verbatim) with the classes they extend.
Refactored formElement() methods to clarify what kind of (non-Drupal) entities we're modifying.
The widgets now add custom CSS selector to the HTML hidden elements, which flag the actual type and that a column is being rendered via Field Hidden.
Added stylesheet which prevents widgets of multiple-rowed instances from being displayed.
